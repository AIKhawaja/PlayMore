(“Programs”) and for the purpose of advertising, marketing and promoting the Programs (including,
without limitation, at public events). Licensee may also use the lyrics and notes in print and display and
may use the title of the Composition in association with any of the foregoing permitted uses. In addition,
this License constitutes a direct license of any and all performance rights which may become payable in
connection with such permitted uses and Licensee need not make any payments or obtain performance
rights society licenses in connection therewith.

(b) Use and exploit the names, likenesses, biographies, logos and trademarks associated with the persons

credit hereunder.

2. Term and Territory. The term of the License shall commence upon the date set forth above and shall
continue in perpetuity (“Term”). The territory of the License is worldwide (“Territory”).

3. Credit. In consideration of the rights granted to Licensee hereunder, Licensee shall accord credit to the
composer(s) and publisher(s) of the Composition, provided that the manner, form and frequency of such
credit shall be determined by Licensee in its sole discretion. Any inadvertent failure to so accord credit
shall not constitute a material breach of the License and Licensee’s sole obligation will be to make good
faith commercially reasonable efforts to prospectively accord the credit prescribed herein; provided,
however, Licensee and its distributors will have no obligation to make changes to any previously created
materials.

4. Facilitative Rights. Without limiting the generality of Paragraphs 1 and/or 2 above, Licensee shall have
the right to alter, expand, adapt, edit, add to, subtract from, combine with other material and make any
arrangements of the Composition, and Licensee will have the sole right to decide whether and in what
manner Owner’s works will be advertised, publicized, performed or exploited (if at all). In connection
therewith, Owner irrevocably waives its so-called “moral rights.”

5. Owner’s Representations, Warranties and Indemnity. Owner hereby represents and warrants that:

(a) The Composition is wholly original to Owner;

(b) The Composition does not and will not infringe upon or violate the copyrights or any other rights
whatsoever of any person or entity;
(c) No adverse claim(s) exist(s) with respect to the Composition;

(d) Owner owns and/or controls one hundred percent (100%) of the copyright in the Composition, and all
rights therein and thereto throughout the world;

(e) Licensee shall have no obligation to make any payment to any third party for Licensee’s exploitation
of the rights granted by Owner hereunder; and

(f) Owner has the full and exclusive right and authority to enter into this Agreement and to make the grant
and representations, warranties and agreements contained herein and that the consent of no third party is
required for Licensor to fully exercise its rights hereunder. Owner agrees to hold Licensee, its parent, and
their respective successors, assigns and licensees, harmless from and against any loss, damage or expense,
including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, suffered or incurred as a result of or relating to any
breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by Owner, including without limitation Owner’s
representations and warranties.

6. Remedies. Owner hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights to seek or obtain any injunctive or
equitable relief against Licensee or its successors, assigns or licensees. Owner acknowledges and agrees
that any breach or anticipatory breach by Owner of this Agreement will cause Licensee irreparable harm
such that money damages alone will be inadequate, and therefore, that Licensee and its successors,
assigns and licensees will be entitled to injunctive or equitable relief (without obligation of posting bond
or surety or establishing harm) in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity, in any court
of competent jurisdiction.

7. Miscellaneous. This writing constitutes the entire understanding of the parties. No other agreement,
written or oral, express or implied, exists between the parties with respect to the Composition and/or the
Master. Any modification or waiver hereunder or termination of this Agreement must be in writing,
signed by both parties. Licensee may freely assign or transfer (including the unlimited right to sublicense)
any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to the permitted
uses hereunder of the Composition. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, such
provision will be severed to the minimum extent necessary for the remaining provisions to be enforceable.
This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements executed
and to be fully performed therein (without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof). This
Agreement may be signed in counterparts and fax and photocopies may be used as an original.
